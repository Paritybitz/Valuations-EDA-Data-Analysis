   - Converts financial columns like **Raised to Date**, **Post Money Valuation**, and **Percent Shares Outstanding** into numerical values.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Plots multiple line graphs with **Share Type** on the X-axis and different financial metrics on the Y-axis.
   - Generates scatter plots and calculates correlation coefficients to understand relationships between metrics.

4. **Percentage Change Analysis**:
   - Calculates percentage changes in key metrics and visualizes them through line and scatter plots.

## Usage
1. Ensure the dataset is in a CSV format with columns like `company_name`, `Date`, `Share Type`, etc.
2. Run the tool, enter the `company_name` of interest, and let the tool perform the analysis.

## Conclusion
